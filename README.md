## How to read the content of this repository: 
Every module contains **blocks** and every block contains **exercises**; these exercises are organized by days. Here is an example:

Introduction-WebDevelopment/block-02/2.1/tryber.js --> here you can find the exercise(s) of day 1 of the **first** day of **block** 2. Confusing? I'll try to explain one more time but in a different way:

2.1 --> refers to block **2** day **1**
